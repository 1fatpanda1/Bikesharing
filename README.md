# Bikesharing

## Overview
We are helping Kate analyze bikesharing data in order to figure out if such a venture would work in Des Moines.

## Results

There were a total of 2,344,224 bike rides recorded in the data. The vast majority of subscribers were subscribers.

The vast majority of trips were around 5 minutes. This trend held pretty steady for all genders.

Saturday was the busiest day between 9am and around 8pm. During the weekday, we can see that a lot of trips were probably people going to work (7-10AM) and coming back (4-8pm). This held mostly for male customers. The heatmaps for unknown users and female users were much less pronounced.

## Summary

Overall, the vast majority of rides were working male subscribers. The vast majority of trips were around 5 minutes. Saturday was the busiest day between 9am and around 8pm. Visualizations to consider would be a heatmap of the week sorting by customer type and gender. A pie chart of customers by usertype and gender would be helpful as well.
